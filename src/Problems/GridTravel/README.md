### Problem description
Say that you are a traveler on a 2D grid. You begin in the top-left
corner and your goal is to travel to the bottom-right corner.
You may only move down or right.

In how many ways can you travel to the goal on a grid with
dimensions m * n?

Write a function `travel(m, n)` that calculates this.
